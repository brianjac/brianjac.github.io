\maketitle

This is a repository for things that I write. I usually write things about math, in particular computer science. I also sometimes write about my professional field, which is digital logic. Views expressed here are my own. Feel free to contact me on Twitter (\href{https://twitter.com/KleeneAlgebraCo}{@KleeneAlgebraCo}), or email me at brian [at] brianjaco [dot] bz if you have questions, comments, or suggestions.
