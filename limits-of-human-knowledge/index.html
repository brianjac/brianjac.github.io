constructing a piece of knowledge that we can prove exists, but which we

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1   </span> <a

<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >For some program encoding (like C, Perl, Lambda Calculus, Turing Machines, etc.),
and for every <span 
class="cmmi-10">n</span>, there exists a value &Omega;<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">n</span></sub> which corresponds to the proportion of
programs of length <span 
class="cmmi-10">n </span>which terminate. We call this value Chaitin&#8217;s Constant for that
program encoding and that length. I will shorthand as just Chaitin&#8217;s Constant or &Omega;<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">n</span></sub>
for simplicity. We can, in general, neither compute nor prove the value of any of
Chaitin&#8217;s Constants, with exceptions for degenerate cases like programs of length
zero, or programs which are too short to have loops represented in our chosen
encoding.<br

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-30001.2"></a>Proof of Lemma</h4>
<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >Let <span 
class="cmtt-10">snooper(p,i) </span>be a function which returns true if its input program <span 
class="cmtt-10">p</span>
halts on input <span 
class="cmtt-10">i</span>, and false if <span 
class="cmtt-10">p </span>runs forever on input <span 
class="cmtt-10">i</span>. We can then write a
program <span 
class="cmtt-10">halter() </span>which takes as input a program <span 
class="cmtt-10">p</span>, calls <span 
class="cmtt-10">snooper(p,p)</span>,
and enters an infinite loop if <span 
class="cmtt-10">snooper(p,p) </span>returns true. If <span 
class="cmtt-10">snooper(p,p)</span>
returns false, <span 
class="cmtt-10">halter(p) </span>returns true. Now there are two options: either
<span 
class="cmtt-10">halter(halter) </span>returns true, or <span 
class="cmtt-10">halter(halter) </span>does not terminate. If
<span 
class="cmtt-10">halter(halter) </span>terminates, returning true, then <span 
class="cmtt-10">snooper(halter,halter)</span>
must return false, implying that <span 
class="cmtt-10">halter(halter) </span>does not terminate. If
<span 
class="cmtt-10">halter(halter) </span>does not terminate, then <span 
class="cmtt-10">snooper(halter,halter) </span>must
return true, implying <span 
class="cmtt-10">halter(halter) </span>does terminate. Either way, we have
a contradiction that arises from the existence of the <span 
class="cmtt-10">snooper program.</span>
Therefore we cannot write this <span 
class="cmtt-10">snooper </span>program; its existence leads to a
contradiction.<br

<span

<span

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-40001.3"></a>Proof of our Theorem:</h4>
<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >By Lemma 0, we cannot write a program which determines whether or not an input
program halts without violating the rule that snooper-like programs cannot exist. If
we know Chaitin&#8217;s constant &Omega;<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">n</span></sub><span 
class="cmmi-10">, </span>then we can write such a program in the following
way, assuming we are attempting to determine the halting of a program of length
<span 
class="cmmi-10">n </span>:<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >
  <dl class="enumerate"><dt class="enumerate">

class="cmmi-10">n.</span>

2. </dt><dd

  </dd><dt class="enumerate">
4. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate">If that ratio matches &Omega;<sub><span

  terminating program to the ratio would cause it to go over &Omega;<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">n</span></sub><span 
class="cmmi-10">, </span>then the
  program we are interested in must not terminate and we can return that it
  does not halt. Alternately, if the program has halted, we can return that it
  halts.
  </dd><dt class="enumerate">
5. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate">If neither of the above cases hold, then we go back to 2.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   Essentially, what&#8217;s happening here is we are conducting a parallel search for all
terminating programs, where we know we are done when we have reached
Chaitin&#8217;s Constant. Since this is a snooper-like program (even though it would
run in a truly horrendous amount of real-world computation time, even
if you have a <span 
class="cmti-10">really </span>fast computer) it cannot exist. Since its existence is
predicated on our knowledge of Chaitin&#8217;s constant, we cannot mathematically
prove the value of Chatin&#8217;s constant. If we can&#8217;t prove a value correct in any
way, we cannot say it is correct, and therefore we cannot know it. QED
