<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >   Rocket Leagues symmetric kickoffs, where both players on the same team are
equidistant from the ball, pose an interesting communications challenge. The two
players have to coordinate, via quickchat, which of them is going to go for the kickoff,
and which is going to hang back, or collect boost, (or, in the case of Solo 3s, practice
their turtle defense.) Each of them can write either Ive got it! or Take the shot! If one
player gets their chat in first, then the other player can decide to either accept the
firsts tactical decision, or attempt to disagree by offering a counterproposal. This
is perhaps not as interesting as the other possible case: both players issue
their quickchats simultaneously. Often this causes confusion and gives the
other team an advantage on the kickoff. As it turns out, this is a problem
that has come up, and been solved, in what might be a surprising place:
WiFi.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >   In the early days of computer networking, two computers could talk to each other
by connecting some wires between them, and having each computer send
messages by adjusting the voltage on the wire in ON-OFF patterns. This
scheme is fairly straightforward, and is at the core of protocols like full duplex
Ethernet.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1x0" id="fn1x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2f1"></a>
We say that the set of wires being used is the physical medium over which the
ethernet link is established.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >   Where things get interesting is when your medium is one which cannot be
isolated. WiFi connections are made via radio waves in the wavelengths around
2.4GHz (or with 802.11n, possibly 5GHz). A particular channel will take up not only
                                                                  

                                                                  
the frequency spectrum at its center, but also some of the frequencies around it. For
this reason, it is difficult to have a dedicated transmission and receive frequency for
each partner in each communication. Theres only a finite amount of bandwidth,
and if youre in a lecture hall of students with their laptops, there will be
far more connections than there are WiFi spectrum channels to support
them.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >   The solution to this problem is to have multiple devices talking on the same channel.
As long as they take turns, they can all use the same bandwidth. The simplest possible
scheme is to have each device simply transmit when they have something to send, and
then throw away any messages which overlap with those sent by other devices. If two
messages<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn2x0" id="fn2x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-3f2"></a>
overlap, even by a little bit, then they interfere with each other, and it is not
possible to tell which parts have been interfered with and which have not,
so both must be discarded in their entirety. As long as messages are sent
infrequently enough that the chances of overlap are low, most messages will get
through.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   What do you do about the messages that do not? One option is to simply give up,
and say that those messages are lost forever. Some networking protocols take this
approach. Perhaps the most popular protocol to do so is UDP, although UDP is
slightly higher up the networking stack than what we are describing. The idea
behind this approach is that either the messages are time sensitive, and
therefore worthless if they do not arrive soon after they are sent, or some
mechanism above them detects that a message is missing and attempts to
retransmit.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >   It would be nice to solve this problem here, instead of punting it up to someone
above us, so we should attempt to retransmit a message if we detect that it
has failed. Naively, we can try resending a message immediately after we
detect that the channel is clear. Unfortunately, if both devices which were
previously transmitting simultaneously are using this same scheme, theyll
both start transmitting again at the same time, when both of them realize
that the other is done with the previous transmission. This will repeat &#8212;
rendering the channel unusable &#8212; until one of the devices is turned off. In
order to resolve this issue, we can implement something called a random
falloff.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >   Random falloff is a strategy where when a device attempts to send a message, and
the message is corrupted by another device trying to transmit at the same time, the
first device waits for a random amount of time before attempting to retransmit. The
hope is that the two devices will chose different random times to wait, and one of
them will get their message in before the other is done waiting. Of course, its always
possible that both will choose similar enough wait times, and get stuck again, but in
this case each can again choose a random wait time, and keep going until
their random sequences of waits desynchronize and one gets in before the
                                                                  

                                                                  
other.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   This works fine for two devices, but if a larger number of devices are
simultaneously trying to use the same channel, its possible that the range of
random falloff times is not great enough, and there is a high probability that
multiple devices will choose the same time within the range. Concretely,
imagine that there are 10 possible times to attempt to begin retransmission,
and 11 devices simultaneously trying to transmit. By the Pigeonhole
Principle<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn3x0" id="fn3x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-4f3"></a>,
at least one pair of messages will conflict. If this recurs, there needs to be a
mechanism for increasing the range of wait times that each device can wait for. The
typical falloff schedule used is to double the range of possible wait times each time a
message is corrupted. This has a nice balance between growing rapidly, so after
several rounds the probability of collision is very low, and keeping the wait times
reasonable.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   This protocol is called Aloha, after the first network to use it, appropriately
named ALOHANet. ALOHANet was the first multi-device wireless packet network.
It was developed at the University of Hawaii in 1971. The name stands for Additive
Links On-line Hawaii Area, which was clearly chosen to fill in the acronym for
the name they had already decided on. Although somewhat primitive, the
ideas were refined into essentially the ones that are used in modern WiFi
networks for bandwidth sharing, and your home router likely uses the same
general ideas of random retransmission to let you use multiple devices at
once.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   This is also, to circle back to our original point, roughly the scheme which is
used by Rocket League players on kickoffs. Each player will wait a random
amount of time before sending a message indicating whether theyd like to
take the kickoff or not. If both players signal their intentions at the same
time, they will each choose some amount of time to wait before signaling
a new intention. The trap that I have seen some players fall into is that
they will always attempt to resignal as soon as the conflict is discovered.
This makes some sense, because there is a limited amount of time before
the kickoff happens, and both players must be in agreement before then.
However, as you might recall, both players attempting to immediately resignal
risks the same issues as in our shared medium network where both players
(or devices) immediately resend and enter a loop of mangling each others
messages.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >   Therefore, the best way to resolve this issue is to pick a random (or, as
random as you can easily produce, given the circumstances) time between the
current time and the time when the kickoff countdown hits zero to send your
follow-up quickchat. I personally skew later, since a lot of people dont realize the
shared medium issue described above, and attempt to immediately correct
the simultaneous quickchat. I typically pick a single time during a series
                                                                  

                                                                  
of games and always resend right around then if there is a simultaneous
quickchat, since it usually doesnt happen more than once a game anyway.
Adopting this Aloha protocol for rocket league kickoffs will reduce the amount of
confusion when a simultaneous quickchat occurs, and does not run the risk of
interacting badly with other peoples strategies, since from your perspective,
everyone is picking a random time to resignal. Some just do it quicker than
others.<br
